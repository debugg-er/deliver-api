This way, one can demonstrate a degree of openness about it, but you don't have to turn them on if your don't want, and it doesn't give much credibility to those who call you a coward for turning them off, since that's how they started. We will still be able to know, however, that the corporations are cowards, since they won't turn them on. Besides just them hiding the dislikes, it's almost like the corporations are hiding themselves, since now no video has the dislike count enabled.
